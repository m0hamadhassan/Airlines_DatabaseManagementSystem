# Airlines_DatabaseManagementSystem

ADBS is operating on-spot airline reservation, and flight booking services with help  of several Airports.
Airlines is having more transactions, causing day to day expanding business 
activities hard to manage its operations. To ensure more flexible service for 
customers, it’s highly recommended to implement Airlines Reservation System 
(ARS), a computerized system that will help manage all information related to flight, 
passengers, their contact details, reservation, transactions, schedule publishing, air 
far payments etc.

Purpose and Method:

ADBS is operating on-spot airline reservation, and flight booking services with help 
of several Airports. Though having branches in multiple cities targeting a high range 
of customers.
The purpose of the system is to facilitate reservation operations, link databases to 
each other accurately, and avoid human errors because one employee sometimes 
fails to satisfy customers in remote areas when they have to travel for reservation 
and also when they need to travel for cancellation or flight day extension. The 
followings below are the system Entities, Attributes, and Relations.
