# Airlines Database Management System (ADBS)

The Airlines Database Management System (ADBS) is designed to handle on-spot airline reservations and flight booking services in collaboration with multiple airports. As the business activities of the airlines continue to expand on a day-to-day basis, it becomes increasingly challenging to manage operations efficiently. To ensure a more flexible and streamlined service for customers, it is crucial to implement an Airlines Reservation System (ARS), a computerized system that manages all aspects of flight information, passenger details, reservations, transactions, schedule publishing, and airfare payments.

## Purpose and Method:

ADBS operates airline reservation and flight booking services through various airports and branches. With branches in multiple cities and a wide range of customers, the purpose of this system is to facilitate reservation operations, accurately link databases, and minimize human errors. It eliminates the need for customers to travel to remote areas for reservations, cancellations, or flight extensions, thereby improving customer satisfaction. The system is designed to handle the following entities, attributes, and relations:
